## Latest Changelog, Next update(s)

- 2.0.0
  - NEW PASSIVE- ENERGY PASSIVE! (MOD COMMISSION/IDEA BY Delta the Wize#5938)
    - Naturally regen 2.5% of energy per second, Melee attacks also regenerate energy (Flat 10, scaling with attackspeed even when not in rage mode, less energy gained while in rage mode).
    - Rage mode now requires max energy, will drain constantly when activated until it reaches 0.
    - Energy capacity increases per level, as well with stock based items (backup magazine, hardlight afterburner).
    - Skills cost energy. Deflect is now active while holding down the button rather than a duration as each 'hit' costs 20 energy to deflect.
    - Energy cost decreases with cooldown based items (purity, alien head).
    - Holding down jump while on the ground does a super jump, costing energy. Holding down jump while falling slows down falling, costing energy.
  - Cooldown based Darth Vader is still an option.
    - Cooldown based also now has in-built slow-falling, holding jump will stop the slow-fall, falling normally.


- Next update(s)
    - Bug fixes.

## Known Issues
- Stuttering when using Aetherium.

## Overview
    Darth Vader is a Juggernaut, with limited mobility but high damage and survivability in close range.
    Darth Vader's Attackspeed and Movespeed don't increase. 
    Instead, Attackspeed bonuses increase Damage, Movespeed bonuses increase Armor.
    His Secondary either pushes or pulls enemies depending if the button has been tapped or held. 
    His Special, Rage Unleashed uncaps these limits, retains the bonuses and 
    doubles his Attackspeed, Movespeed, Armor and removes Cooldowns from all his skills.
    Aim to increase your Attackspeed and Movespeed as these stats are still valuable to him.
